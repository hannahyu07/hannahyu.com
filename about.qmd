# University of Toronto (UofT)

Hi there, my name is Hannah Yu. I'm a **third year** undergrad student at the University of Toronto. Pursuing a double major in **economics** and **statistics** with a **focus on data analysis** has provided me with invaluable opportunities to delve into the intersection of these fields. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed a proficient command of several statistical software tools, including **R**, **Stata**, **Python**, and **SQL**.

This academic journey has not only equipped me with technical skills but also allowed me to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications in the financial world. I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to tackle real-world challenges and drive informed decision-making. My experiences have prepared me for roles and projects where I can apply my statistical tools and programming knowledge to analyze economic trends and inform policy decisions on a broader scale.

My university experience has been incredibly fulfilling, extending far beyond the confines of the classroom. As the **marketing director** of **UT Chinese**, a student non-profit organization, I've had the privilege of leading our social media efforts, managing accounts with a combined following of over **10,000** individuals. In previous roles, such as co-chair and marketing head, I've orchestrated successful events like the **ACE 2023 Career Fair**, which attracted over **200** attendees, and the 2022 Summer Open HouseProgram, which saw participation from over **500** individuals. Additionally, my role as an event associate at **UT Policython** allowed me to ensure the smooth execution of club events, fostering an enjoyable experience for all attendees. I've also dedicated my time to volunteering at **Caffiends**, a student-run environmentally friendly cafe on campus. These experiences have not only honed my leadership and organizational skills but also deepened my connection to the UofT community.

# University College London (UCL)

Last semester, I had the privilege of studying economics at University College London (UCL) in London, which provided me with unique academic and cultural experiences. This opportunity allowed me to explore academic avenues not available at UofT and engage with professionals from diverse backgrounds. Immersing myself in various extracurricular activities at UCL, such as the asset management society, data science society, and impact career society, broadened my horizons and allowed me to interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Exploring European culture during my free time, visiting museums, galleries, and historical sites, and making friends from around the world further enriched my experience

Reflecting on my time at both UCL and UofT, I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to study at two renowned institutions during my undergraduate years. It was a transformative experience that has left an incredible mark on my academic and personal growth.

# Just a Little More of me...

Beyond academics and extracurriculars, I have many other hobbies and interests, including music, baking, traveling, spending time with dogs, listening to podcasts, and drinking bubble tea. If you'd like to connect and chat, feel free to find me on social media!
